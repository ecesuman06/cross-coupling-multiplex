# cross-coupling-multiplex

The code fhn_50_multi_run.m is the code for one node perturbation, check the synchronization manifolds and time series
fhn_multi_reg_dis_run.m is for the distribution in one layer (all nodes in layer-1)
sol_time_rewrite_multi_50_run.m is for role of cross-coupling when the mismatch is introduced at different time with and without cross-coupling link in case of perturbation in node-2 in layer-1
